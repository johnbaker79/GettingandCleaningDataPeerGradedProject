# 2). The included run_analysis.R, conducts the following:

# Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.

# Read train and test datasets and merge the x(measurements), y(activity) and subject, respectively.

# Load data, features, activity info and extract columns named 'mean'(-mean) and 'standard'(-std). Mod column names to descriptive. (-mean to Mean, std to Std, and remove symbols like -, (, )).

# Extract data in selected columns, and merge x, y(activity) and subject data. Replace y(activity) column to it's name by refering to activity labels.

# Generate #2 dataframe for 'tidy dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity. Assign to file - tidy_dataset.txt.
